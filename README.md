Forecasting and Trading of the Stable Cryptocurrencies with Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms for Market Analytics
This study proposes a Predictive Analytics System to provide simplified reporting for the three most popular cryptocurrencies with varying digits, namely ADA Cardano, Ethereum, and Binance, for ten days to contribute to this emerging technology.To achieve this, the proposed system employs a data science framework and six highly advanced data-driven Machine learning and Deep learning algorithms: Support Vector Regressor, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Facebook (FB) Prophet, Unidirectional LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, Stacked LSTM. Moreover, the research experiments are repeated several times to achieve the best results, involving hyperparameter tuning of each algorithm. This includes selecting the appropriate kernel and suitable data normalization technique for SVR, determining ARIMAâ€™s (p, d, q) values, and optimizing the loss function values, number of neurons, hidden layers, and epochs in LSTM models. For the model validation, we utilize widely used evaluation techniques: Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error, and R-Squared. Results demonstrate that ARIMA outperforms the other models in all cases, accurately projecting the price variability within the actual price range. Conversely, FB Prophet exhibits good performance to some extent. Our project suggests that the ARIMA technique offers practical implications for market analysts, enabling them to make well-informed decisions based on accurate price
projections.
